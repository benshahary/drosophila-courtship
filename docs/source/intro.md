Courtship in *Drosophila melanogaster* consists of an extremely rich series of 
stereotyped behaviors, the analysis of which---in conjunction with genetic 
and neural manipulations---can provide insights into the sensory stimuli and
brain circuitry that coordinate complex behavioral decisions. Courtship has 
traditionally been hand-scored in a binary manner, whereby a male fly is either
courting or not courting a target female. The vast majority of studies which
use courtship as a behavioral output use these simple binary data to calculate 
two main parameters: the fraction of time a male spends courting a female 
(termed the courtship index) and the time taken for the male to initiate 
courtship (called the courtship latency). While these parameters have been
instrumental in advancing diverse areas of research, they are certainly 
not capable of capturing the the full complexity and relationship of individual
courtship behaviors to one another.
